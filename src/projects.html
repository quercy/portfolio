	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>
	My senior project to complete my CS degree. It was a full-stack prototype for a cross-platform mobile shopping cart application for a (now-defunct) literal farm-to-table delivery company. The app allowed users to register, select a date for delivery, view categories of foods, add items to the cart, and check out.
	</p>
	<h4>Retrospective</h4>
	<p>This project went from design to deployment/presentation in about 3 days, so there were necessary constraints on the scope; however, the short timeline was a good exercise in crunch-work, and was good practice to picking up new technologies lightning-quick. Given more time, I would have refactored to use a JS framework like Angular, Vue, etc.</p>
	<h4>Technologies used</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PHP
			<ul>
				<li>PDO extension</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank">Slim</a> - framework for the REST API</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>MySQL</li>
		<li>JavaScript
			<ul>
				<li>jQuery + jQuery Mobile</li>
			</ul>

	<h2><a href="http://www.quercy.co/" target="_blank">This site</a></h2>
	<p>I started with a simple sketch of the layout in Photoshop, and then mocked it up in HTML/CSS. I then made a build system using Gulp to compile, minify, and concatenate the JS and SASS, using Node to run the server, but that quickly got unweildy for such a small site. I stumbled on <a href="http://metalsmith.io" target="_blank">Metalsmith</a>, a static site generator based on plugins and file-based pages and templates - which is perfect in terms of speed and ease. I added file watchers to automatically compile the site and autoreload any open pages for rapid develoment, and a Makefile to quickly deploy. This made it easy to switch from EC2 to S3 hosting for the site, simply by modifying the deploy script; nothing else had to change.</p>
	<h4>To do</h4>
	<p>Next, I want to include some sort of very basic tests, to cancel a "deployment" if (for example) any pages are broken.</p>
	<h4>Technologies used</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>JavaScript
			<ul>
				<li>Node/npm - package management, building, scripting, deploying</li>
				<li>jQuery with Velocity - animation, DOM manipulation</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>SASS</li>
		<li>bash - deploy script, Makefile</li>
		<li>Photoshop - mockups/logo</li>
		<li>Mustache templates</li>
