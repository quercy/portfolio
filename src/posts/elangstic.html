<p>This article will show you how to connect Elasticsearch's API to Angular for blazingly fast full-text all-field searches; the example application is a type-to-search-engine.</p>

<h3 id="intro-ang">Introduction to Angular</h3>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Angular, and can handle a bit of dryness, <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction" target="_blank">AngularJS' own introduction</a> is great. If you like the idea of a tour of a pre-built application with concepts being explained on the way, go grab <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/angularjs-in-action" target="_blank">AngularJS in Action</a>. If you are slightly familiar with Angular but don't know, for example, the difference between a provider, factory, and service -- <a href="http://tylermcginnis.com/angularjs-factory-vs-service-vs-provider/" target="_blank">Tyler McGinness</a> is a great resource (but keep in mind that while a factory is a service - <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services" target="_blank">they are all singletons!</a>). If you don't know Javascript, I'm not sure what you're doing here.

<h3 id="intro-ela">Introduction to Elastic/Elasticsearch</h3>
<p>Elasticsearch deserves an entire book written about it. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html" target="_blank">Thankfully, the beautiful people at Elastic wrote one for you.</a>. If you're short on time, the key points are this:
<h4>Elasticsearch is...</h4>
<ul>
<li>"A real-time distributed search and analytics engine."</li>
<li>"A distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable."</li>
<li>"A distributed search engine with real-time analytics."</li>
<li>"Capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data"</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h4>But for our puropses, Elastic search is...</h4>
<ul>
<li>Really, really, really fast at full text searches over many fields</li>
<li>Really, really easy to throw data at</li>
<li>Really easy to set up</li>
<li>Not as easy to get started querying with Angular</li>
<li>Exposes its interface via a RESTy API</li>
<li>Utilizes a JSONy document store</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure of the application</h3>
<h4>Angular</h4>
<pre><code class='javascript'>
angular.module('Elangstic')
    .constant('elasticConfig', {
		// the address and log level for elasticsearch will go here
    })

    .controller('SearchCtrl', function() {
		// this will control the textbox for searching and display of results
    })

    .directive('egResult', function() {
		// this will be a directive that binds the result to the dom via a template
    })

    .factory('SearchMdl', function() {
    	// the search model will build a facade around the confusing ES client
    })

    .service('esClient', function () {
		// this will actually instantiate the connection to the elasticsearch server
    });
</code></pre>
<h4>HTML</h4>
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html ng-app=&quot;Elangstic&quot;&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;!-- JS, CSS --&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;SearchCtrl&quot;&gt;
			&lt;!-- Search input and results --&gt;
	    &lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
